        <p>
          I'm a software engineer at <a className="link" target="__blank" href="https://weaviate.io">Weaviate</a> trained as a physicist living in Manchester, UK.

        <p>
          My current interests surround <a className="link" target="__blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution">Industry 4.0</a> and
          the imminent societal revolution brought about the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Having read Azimov's Foundation series and Robot short stories
          as a young adult, to find many of the core concepts and ideas of the books being realised in my lifetime is a dream come true!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not hacking on personal ideas and contributing to open-source projects, I enjoy video games, team sports, and going on trail hikes in the North of England.
